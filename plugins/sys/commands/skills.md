description: List all available skills in table format
---
List all available skills from the Skill tool. Format as a table with columns: Registry, Plugin, Skill Name, Description. Registry is the project name (e.g., superpowers-marketplace, prompt-plugins); leave empty if none. Plugin is the plugin name. Skill Name is the skill name with the plugin prefix removed. Sort by registry first, then by plugin name. Keep descriptions concise (one line each).
